# Chagnolet

My grandparents have a property that had a very dated website. As a first project I decided to give it an upgrade. Styling isn't my fort√©
so I have opted for a clean simple look.


## Deployment

I used FileZilla to securely upload all the files to my chosen web hosting service.


## Built With

HTML5,CSS3 and PHP
